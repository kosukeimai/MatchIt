\section{\texttt{summary()}: Numerical Summaries of Balance}

\subsection{Description}
The \texttt{summary()} command returns numerical summaries of balance
diagnostics.

\subsection{Syntax}
\begin{verbatim}
summary(object, interactions = FALSE, addlvariables = NULL, ...)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Arguments}

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{object}: the output from {\tt matchit()}.
\item \texttt{interactions}: an option to calculate summary
  statistics in \texttt{sum.all} and \texttt{sum.matched} for all
  covariates, their squares, and two-way interactions when
  \texttt{interactions = TRUE} and only the covariates themselves when
  \texttt{interactions = FALSE} (default).
\item \texttt{addlvariables}: additional variables on which to
  calculate the diagnostic statistics (in addition to the variables
  included in the matching procedure) (default = NULL).
  \texttt{addlvariables}: a data frame containing additional variables
  whose balance is examined. The data should come with the same number
  of units and units in the same order as in the data set used for
  {\tt matchit()}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Output Values}

The output from the \texttt{summary()} command includes the following
elements, when applicable:
\begin{itemize}
\item The original assignment model call.
\item \texttt{sum.all}: a data frame that contains variable names and
  interactions down the row names, and summary statistics on \emph{all
    observations} in each of the columns.  The columns in
  \texttt{sum.all} contain \footnote{The output for full matching is
    slightly different from that described here; see Section
    \ref{subsubsec:full} for details.}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item means of all covariates $X$ for treated and control units,
    where \texttt{Means Treated}$= \mu_{X|T=1} = \frac{1}{n_1}
    \sum_{T=1} X_i$ and \texttt{Means Control}$= \mu_{X|T=0} =
    \frac{1}{n_0} \sum_{T=0} X_i$,
  \item standard deviation in the treated group for all covariates $X$,  
        $$\quad s_{x|T=1} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i \in \{i: T_i=1\}}
        (X_i - \mu_{X|T=1}}{n_1-1})^2 }.$$
  \item summary statistics from a Q-Q plot, which compares treated and
    control covariate distributions, where \texttt{QQ Med}, \texttt{QQ
      Mean}, and \texttt{QQ Max} indicate the median, mean, and
    maximum orthogonal deviations from the 45 degree line of a Q-Q
    plot.
  \item standardized bias statistics, $${\rm Std.
      Bias}=\frac{\mu_{X|T=1} - \mu_{X|T=0}}{s_{x|T=1}}.$$
  \end{itemize}
  
\item \texttt{sum.matched}: a data frame which contains variable names
  down the row names, and summary statistics on only the \emph{matched
    observations} in each of the columns.  Specifically, the columns
  in \texttt{sum.matched} contain the following elements\footnote{The
    values output for full matching are slightly different from that
    described here; see Section \ref{subsubsec:full} for details}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item weighted means for matched treatment units of all covariates
    $X$ and their interactions, where \texttt{Means Treated}$=
    \mu_{wX|T=1} = \frac{1}{n_1} \sum_{T=1} w_iX_i$ and \texttt{Means
      Control}$=\mu_{wX|T=0} = \frac{1}{n_0} \sum_{T=0} w_iX_i$,
  \item weighted standard deviations in the matched treated group for
    all covariates $X$, where \texttt{SD} $= s_{wX} =
    \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i} (w_iX_i - \overline{X}^*)^2}$, where
    $\overline{X}^*$ is the weighted mean of $X$ in the matched
    treated group, and
  \item standardized bias statistics \texttt{Std.
      Bias}$=\frac{\mu_{wX|T=1} - \mu_{wX|T=0}}{s_{x|T=1}}$.
  \end{itemize}
  where $w$ represents the vector of \texttt{weights}.
  
\item \texttt{reduction}: the percent bias reduction achieved in each
  of the balance measures in \texttt{sum.all} and
  \texttt{sum.matched}, defined as $100(|a|-|b|)/|a|$, where $a$ was
  the value of the balance measure before matching and $b$ is the
  value of the balance measure after matching.  Because the difference
  in means and the standardized bias differ only by a constant (the
  standard deviation in the full treated group), the percent reduction
  in bias is the same for these two measures, and thus is only printed
  out once.
  
\item \texttt{nn}: the sample sizes in the full and matched samples
  and the number of discarded units, by treatment and control.
  
\item \texttt{q.table}: an array that contains the same information
  as \texttt{sum.matched} by subclass.
  
\item \texttt{qn}: the sample sizes in the full and matched
  samples and the number of discarded units, by subclass and by
  treatment and control.
\item \texttt{match.matrix}: the same object is contained in the
  output of {\tt matchit()}.
\end{itemize}
