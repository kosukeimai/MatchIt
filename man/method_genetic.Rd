\title{Genetic Matching}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{a two-sided \link{formula} object containing the treatment and
covariates to be used in creating the distance measure used in the matching.
This formula will be supplied to the functions that estimate the distance
measure and is used to determine the covariates whose balance is to be
optimized.}

\item{data}{a data frame containing the variables named in \code{formula}.
If not found in \code{data}, the variables will be sought in the
environment.}

\item{method}{set here to \code{"genetic"}.}

\item{distance}{the distance measure to be used. See \code{\link{distance}}
for allowable options. When set to a method of estimating propensity scores
or a numeric vector of distance values, the distance measure is included
with the covariates in \code{formula} to be supplied to the generalized
Mahalanobis distance matrix unless \code{mahvars} is specified. Otherwise,
only the covariates in \code{formula} are supplied to the generalized
Mahalanobis distance matrix to have their scaling factors chosen.
\code{distance} \emph{cannot} be supplied as a distance matrix. Supplying
any method of computing a distance matrix (e.g., \code{"mahalanobis"}) has
the same effect of omitting propensity score but does not affect how the
distance between units is computed otherwise.}

\item{link}{when \code{distance} is specified as a method of estimating
propensity scores, an additional argument controlling the link function used
in estimating the distance measure. See \code{\link{distance}} for allowable
options with each option.}

\item{distance.options}{a named list containing additional arguments
supplied to the function that estimates the distance measure as determined
by the argument to \code{distance}.}

\item{estimand}{a string containing the desired estimand. Allowable options
include \code{"ATT"} and \code{"ATC"}. See Details.}

\item{exact}{for which variables exact matching should take place.}

\item{mahvars}{when a distance corresponds to a propensity score (e.g., for
caliper matching or to discard units for common support), which covariates
should be supplied to the generalized Mahalanobis distance matrix for
matching. If unspecified, all variables in \code{formula} will be supplied
to the distance matrix. Use \code{mahvars} to only supply a subset. Even if
\code{mahvars} is specified, balance will be optimized on all covariates in
\code{formula}. See Details.}

\item{antiexact}{for which variables anti-exact matching should take place.
Anti-exact matching is processed using the \code{restrict} argument to
\code{Matching::GenMatch()} and \code{Matching::Match()}.}

\item{discard}{a string containing a method for discarding units outside a
region of common support. Only allowed when \code{distance} corresponds to a
propensity score.}

\item{reestimate}{if \code{discard} is not \code{"none"}, whether to
re-estimate the propensity score in the remaining sample prior to matching.}

\item{s.weights}{the variable containing sampling weights to be incorporated
into propensity score models and balance statistics. These are also supplied
to \code{GenMatch()} for use in computing the balance t-test p-values in the
process of matching.}

\item{replace}{whether matching should be done with replacement.}

\item{m.order}{the order that the matching takes place. Allowable options
include \code{"largest"}, where matching takes place in descending order of
distance measures; \code{"smallest"}, where matching takes place in ascending
order of distance measures; \code{"random"}, where matching takes place
in a random order; and \code{"data"} where matching takes place based on the
order of units in the data. When \code{m.order = "random"}, results may differ
across different runs of the same code unless a seed is set and specified
with \code{\link[=set.seed]{set.seed()}}. The default of \code{NULL} corresponds to \code{"largest"} when a
propensity score is estimated or supplied as a vector and \code{"data"}
otherwise.}

\item{caliper}{the width(s) of the caliper(s) used for caliper matching. See
Details and Examples.}

\item{std.caliper}{\code{logical}; when calipers are specified, whether they
are in standard deviation units (\code{TRUE}) or raw units (\code{FALSE}).}

\item{ratio}{how many control units should be matched to each treated unit
for k:1 matching. Should be a single integer value.}

\item{verbose}{\code{logical}; whether information about the matching
process should be printed to the console. When \code{TRUE}, output from
\code{GenMatch()} with \code{print.level = 2} will be displayed. Default is
\code{FALSE} for no printing other than warnings.}

\item{\dots}{additional arguments passed to \pkgfun{Matching}{GenMatch}.
Potentially useful options include \code{pop.size}, \code{max.generations},
and \code{fit.func}. If \code{pop.size} is not specified, a warning from
\emph{Matching} will be thrown reminding you to change it. Note that the
\code{ties} and \code{CommonSupport} arguments are set to \code{FALSE} and
cannot be changed. If \code{distance.tolerance} is not specified, it is set
to 0, whereas the default in \emph{Matching} is 1e-5.}

\description{
In \code{\link[=matchit]{matchit()}}, setting \code{method = "genetic"} performs genetic matching.
Genetic matching is a form of nearest neighbor matching where distances are
computed as the generalized Mahalanobis distance, which is a generalization
of the Mahalanobis distance with a scaling factor for each covariate that
represents the importance of that covariate to the distance. A genetic
algorithm is used to select the scaling factors. The scaling factors are
chosen as those which maximize a criterion related to covariate balance,
which can be chosen, but which by default is the smallest p-value in
covariate balance tests among the covariates. This method relies on and is a
wrapper for \pkgfun{Matching}{GenMatch} and \pkgfun{Matching}{Match}, which use
\pkgfun{rgenoud}{genoud} to perform the optimization using the genetic
algorithm.

This page details the allowable arguments with \code{method = "genetic"}.
See \code{\link[=matchit]{matchit()}} for an explanation of what each argument means in a general
context and how it can be specified.

Below is how \code{matchit()} is used for genetic matching:
\preformatted{
matchit(formula,
        data = NULL,
        method = "genetic",
        distance = "glm",
        link = "logit",
        distance.options = list(),
        estimand = "ATT",
        exact = NULL,
        mahvars = NULL,
        antiexact = NULL,
        discard = "none",
        reestimate = FALSE,
        s.weights = NULL,
        replace = FALSE,
        m.order = NULL,
        caliper = NULL,
        ratio = 1,
        verbose = FALSE,
        ...) }
}
\details{
In genetic matching, covariates play three roles: 1) as the variables on
which balance is optimized, 2) as the variables in the generalized
Mahalanobis distance between units, and 3) in estimating the propensity
score. Variables supplied to \code{formula} are always used for role (1), as
the variables on which balance is optimized. When \code{distance}
corresponds to a propensity score, the covariates are also used to estimate
the propensity score (unless it is supplied). When \code{mahvars} is
specified, the named variables will form the covariates that go into the
distance matrix. Otherwise, the variables in \code{formula} along with the
propensity score will go into the distance matrix. This leads to three ways
to use \code{distance} and \code{mahvars} to perform the matching:

\enumerate{
\item{When \code{distance} corresponds to a propensity score and \code{mahvars}
\emph{is not} specified, the covariates in \code{formula} along with the
propensity score are used to form the generalized Mahalanobis distance
matrix. This is the default and most typical use of \code{method = "genetic"} in \code{matchit()}.
}
\item{When \code{distance} corresponds to a propensity score and \code{mahvars}
\emph{is} specified, the covariates in \code{mahvars} are used to form the
generalized Mahalanobis distance matrix. The covariates in \code{formula}
are used to estimate the propensity score and have their balance optimized
by the genetic algorithm. The propensity score is not included in the
generalized Mahalanobis distance matrix.
}
\item{When \code{distance} is a method of computing a distance matrix
(e.g.,\code{"mahalanobis"}), no propensity score is estimated, and the
covariates in \code{formula} are used to form the generalized Mahalanobis
distance matrix. Which specific method is supplied has no bearing on how the
distance matrix is computed; it simply serves as a signal to omit estimation
of a propensity score.
}
}

When a caliper is specified, any variables mentioned in \code{caliper},
possibly including the propensity score, will be added to the matching
variables used to form the generalized Mahalanobis distance matrix. This is
because \emph{Matching} doesn't allow for the separation of caliper
variables and matching variables in genetic matching.
\subsection{Estimand}{

The \code{estimand} argument controls whether control
units are selected to be matched with treated units (\code{estimand = "ATT"}) or treated units are selected to be matched with control units
(\code{estimand = "ATC"}). The "focal" group (e.g., the treated units for
the ATT) is typically made to be the smaller treatment group, and a warning
will be thrown if it is not set that way unless \code{replace = TRUE}.
Setting \code{estimand = "ATC"} is equivalent to swapping all treated and
control labels for the treatment variable. When \code{estimand = "ATC"}, the
default \code{m.order} is \code{"smallest"}, and the \code{match.matrix}
component of the output will have the names of the control units as the
rownames and be filled with the names of the matched treated units (opposite
to when \code{estimand = "ATT"}). Note that the argument supplied to
\code{estimand} doesn't necessarily correspond to the estimand actually
targeted; it is merely a switch to trigger which treatment group is
considered "focal". Note that while \code{GenMatch()} and \code{Match()}
support the ATE as an estimand, \code{matchit()} only supports the ATT and
ATC for genetic matching.
}

\subsection{Reproducibility}{

Genetic matching involves a random component, so a seed must be set using \code{\link[=set.seed]{set.seed()}} to ensure reproducibility. When \code{cluster} is used for parallel processing, the seed must be compatible with parallel processing (e.g., by setting \code{type = "L'Ecuyer-CMRG"}).
}
}
\section{Outputs}{

All outputs described in \code{\link[=matchit]{matchit()}} are returned with
\code{method = "genetic"}. When \code{replace = TRUE}, the \code{subclass}
component is omitted. When \code{include.obj = TRUE} in the call to
\code{matchit()}, the output of the call to \pkgfun{Matching}{GenMatch} will be
included in the output.
