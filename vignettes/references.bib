  abstract = {Objective: This study provides guidance on how propensity score methods can be combined with moderation analyses (i.e., effect modification) to examine subgroup differences in potential causal effects in nonexperimental studies. As a motivating example, we focus on how depression may affect subsequent substance use differently for men and women. Method: Using data from a longitudinal community cohort study (N = 952) of urban African Americans with assessments in childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, and midlife, we estimate the influence of depression by young adulthood on substance use outcomes in midlife, and whether that influence varies by gender. We illustrate and compare 5 different techniques for estimating subgroup effects using propensity score methods, including separate propensity score models and matching for men and women, a joint propensity score model for men and women with matching separately and together by gender, and a joint male/female propensity score model that includes theoretically important gender interactions with matching separately and together by gender. Results: Analyses showed that estimating separate models for men and women yielded the best balance and, therefore, is a preferred technique when subgroup analyses are of interest, at least in this data. Results also showed substance use consequences of depression but no significant gender differences. Conclusions: It is critical to prespecify subgroup effects before the estimation of propensity scores and to check balance within subgroups regardless of the type of propensity score model used. Results also suggest that depression may affect multiple substance use outcomes in midlife for both men and women relatively equally. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved).

  abstract = {Decision makers require cost-effectiveness estimates for patient subgroups. In nonrandomized studies, propensity score (PS) matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) can address overt selection bias, but only if they balance observed covariates between treatment groups. Genetic matching (GM) matches on the PS and individual covariates using an automated search algorithm to directly balance baseline covariates. This article compares these methods for estimating subgroup effects in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA). The motivating case study is a CEA of a pharmaceutical intervention, drotrecogin alfa (DrotAA), for patient subgroups with severe sepsis (n = 2726). Here, GM reported better covariate balance than PS matching and IPTW. For the subgroup at a high level of baseline risk, the probability that DrotAA was cost-effective ranged from 30\% (IPTW) to 90\% (PS matching and GM), at a threshold of \textsterling 20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. We then compared the methods in a simulation study, in which initially the PS was correctly specified and then misspecified, for example, by ignoring the subgroup-specific treatment assignment. Relative performance was assessed as bias and root mean squared error (RMSE) in the estimated incremental net benefits. When the PS was correctly specified and inverse probability weights were stable, each method performed well; IPTW reported the lowest RMSE. When the subgroup-specific treatment assignment was ignored, PS matching and IPTW reported covariate imbalance and bias; GM reported better balance, less bias, and more precise estimates. We conclude that if the PS is correctly specified and the weights for IPTW are stable, each method can provide unbiased cost-effectiveness estimates. However, unlike IPTW and PS matching, GM is relatively robust to PS misspecification.},

  abstract = {In this article, we present a new way of matching in observational studies that overcomes three limitations of existing matching approaches. First, it directly balances covariates with multi-valued treatments without explicitly estimating the generalized propensity score. Second, it builds self-weighted matched samples that are representative of a target population by design. Third, it can handle large datasets, with hundreds of thousands of observations, in a couple of minutes. The key insights of this new approach to matching are balancing the treatment groups relative to a target population and positing a linear-sized mixed integer formulation of the matching problem. We formally show that this formulation is more effective than alternative quadratic-sized formulations, as its reduction in size does not affect its strength from the standpoint of its linear programming relaxation. We also show that this formulation can be used for matching with distributional covariate balance in polynomial time under certain assumptions on the covariates and that it can handle large datasets in practice even when the assumptions are not satisfied. This algorithmic characterization is key to handling large datasets. We illustrate this new approach to matching in both a simulation study and an observational study of the impact of an earthquake on educational attainment. With this approach, the results after matching can be visualized with simple and transparent graphical displays: while increasing levels of exposure to the earthquake have a negative impact on school attendance, there is no effect on college admission test scores. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {Summary In February 2010, a massive earthquake struck Chile, causing devastation in certain parts of the country, affecting other areas, and leaving territories untouched. 2 months after the earthquake, Chile's Ministry of Social Development reinterviewed a representative subsample of its National Socioeconomic Characterization Survey, which had been completed 2 months before the earthquake, thereby creating a prospective longitudinal survey with detailed information of the same individuals before and after the earthquake. We use a new weighting method for non-experimental studies with multivalued treatments to estimate the effect of levels of exposure to the earthquake on post-traumatic stress. Unlike common weighting approaches for multivalued treatments, this new method does not require explicit modelling of the generalized propensity score and instead focuses on directly balancing the covariates across the multivalued treatments with weights that have minimum variance. As a result, the weighting estimator is stable and approximately unbiased. Furthermore, the weights are constrained to avoid model extrapolation. We illustrate this new method in a simulation study, with both categorical and continuous treatments. The results show that directly targeting balance instead of explicitly modelling the treatment assignment probabilities tends to provide the best results in terms of bias and root-mean-square error. Using this method, we estimate the effect of the intensity of the earthquake on post-traumatic stress. We implement this method in the new package msbw for R.},

Commonly used estimands include the average treatment effect in the treated (ATT), the average treatment effect in the untreated (ATU), the average treatment effect in the population (ATE), and the average treatment effect in the overlap (i.e., equipoise population; ATO). Each estimand has its own assumptions, interpretation, and statistical methods that can be used to estimate it. This article provides guidance on selecting and interpreting an estimand to help medical researchers correctly implement statistical methods used to estimate causal effects in observational studies and to help audiences correctly interpret the results and limitations of these studies. The interpretations of the estimands resulting from regression and instrumental variable analyses are also discussed. Choosing an estimand carefully is essential for making valid inferences from the analysis of observational data and ensuring results are replicable and useful for practitioners.},

	abstract = {We introduce profile matching, a multivariate matching method for randomized experiments and observational studies that finds the largest possible unweighted samples across multiple treatment groups that are balanced relative to a covariate profile. This covariate profile can represent a specific population or a target individual, facilitating the generalization and personalization of causal inferences. For generalization, because the profile often amounts to summary statistics for a target population, profile matching does not always require accessing individual-level data, which may be unavailable for confidentiality reasons. For personalization, the profile comprises the characteristics of a single individual. Profile matching achieves covariate balance by construction, but unlike existing approaches to matching, it does not require specifying a matching ratio, as this is implicitly optimized for the data. The method can also be used for the selection of units for study follow-up, and it readily applies to multivalued treatments with many treatment categories. We evaluate the performance of profile matching in a simulation study of the generalization of a randomized trial to a target population. We further illustrate this method in an exploratory observational study of the relationship between opioid use and mental health outcomes. We analyze these relationships for three covariate profiles representing: (i) sexual minorities, (ii) the Appalachian United States, and (iii) the characteristics of a hypothetical vulnerable patient. The method can be implemented via the new function profmatch in the designmatch package for R, for which we provide a step-by-step tutorial.},
