### Overview

`MatchIt` provides a simple and straightforward interface to various methods of matching for covariate balance in observational studies. Matching is one way to reduce confounding and model dependence when estimating treatment effects. Several matching methods are available, including nearest neighbor matching, optimal pair matching, optimal full matching, genetic matching, exact matching, coarsened exact matching, and subclassification, some of which rely on functions from other R packages. A variety of methods to estimate propensity scores for propensity score matching are included. Below is an example of the use of `MatchIt` to perform full matching and assess balance:

```{r}
library("MatchIt")
data("lalonde", package = "MatchIt")
#Full matching on the propensity score
m.out <- matchit(treat ~ age + educ + race + married + nodegree + re74 + re75, 
                 data = lalonde, method = "full")
```

Printing the `MatchIt` object provides details of the kind of matching performed. 

```{r}
m.out
```

We can check covariate balance for the original and matched samples using `summary()`:

```{r}
#Checking balance before and after matching:
summary(m.out)
```

At the top is balance for the original sample. Below that is balance in the matched sample, followed by the percent reduction in imbalance and the sample sizes before and after matching. Smaller values for the balance statistics indicate better balance. We can plot the standardized mean differences in a Love plot for a clean, visual display of balance across the sample:

```{r}
#Plot balance
plot(summary(m.out))
```

Although much has been written about matching theory, most of the theory relied upon in `MatchIt` is described well in [Ho, Imai, King, and Stuart (2007)](https//:doi.org/10.1093/pan/mpl013) and [Stuart (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1214/09-STS313). The *Journal of Statistical Software* article for `MatchIt` can be accessed [here](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v042.i08), though note that some options have changed, so the `MatchIt` reference pages and included vignettes should be used for understanding the functions and methods available. Further references for individual methods are present in their respective help pages. The `MatchIt` [website](https://kosukeimai.github.io/MatchIt/) provides access to vignettes and documentation files.

### Citing `MatchIt`

Please cite `MatchIt` when using it for analysis presented in publications, which you can do by citing the *Journal of Statistical Software* article below:
